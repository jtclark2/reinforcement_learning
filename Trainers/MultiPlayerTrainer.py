This is probably beyond the scope of this project, but I'm stubbing in the concept. For a multi-player environment,
the competing agents need to be incorporated, as well as the environment itself. This is intended to train agents
against eachother. In the simplest form, this would probably just allow 2 agents taking turns; however, asynchronous
updates should also be possible, probably just by passing None in for other agent's actions. >2 should be possible as
well. And theoretically they could be collaborative or adversarial. These factors may eventually spawn a multitude of
agents.
